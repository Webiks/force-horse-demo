# Force-Horse-Demo

This is a demo application showing how to use the [force-horse](https://github.com/Webiks/force-horse) web component within an Angular application.

While this demo is only using Angular, the code is generalizes and can be ported to native JS, React, Vue, or whatever by just copying the `app.component` logic.
